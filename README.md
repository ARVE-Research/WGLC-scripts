Scripts used to create the WWLLN Global Lightning Climatology (WGLC)

The scripts and fortran program in these subdirectories were used to postprocess raw georeferenced and timestamped lightning stroke counts from the World Wide Lightning Location Network [WWLLN](https://wwlln.net) and create a gridded, detectionn-efficiency corrected global timeseries and climatology of lightning stroke density.
